Equipment Requirements
----------------------

| So before we can actually get started on Programming Fundamentals we're gonna need a few things. You can't be a mechanic without tools, and you can't be a programmer without a computer. You can try learning Programming on a phone or a tablet but it's just gonna be so much more of a hassle compared to just doing it the way you're supposed to do it. So, let's get started.
|
| Stuff to get:

*    Computer:

    | Any computer is fine, as long as it's not a phone or a tablet. It NEEDS to be running some form of Windows, or Linux. Either option is fine.
    | If you don't have a computer yet but want to make a purchase for it, then contact me via Discord (Woha #6430) and I can help out with making a proper decision. You can also just go to Tech channels and internet forums to figure things out on your own. Ultimately if your budget is low then your best option is a used computer with an SSD.

*    Visual Studio:

    | You can use whatever compiler and IDE you want. There's many options out there, each with its own standards it follows and methods to use it. Personally I use Visual Studio for Windows, and VSCode with the clangd addon and the G++ compiler on Linux. It's upto you for whatever you want to use, but if you're using Windows, then Visual Studio is the easiest option. You just install it and use it, no extra things involved.

*    Keyboard:

    | Just make sure it's not broken and all the keys are fine. Programming is all about typing. Even individual letters being misplaced can cause everything to fail.

*    Pen and Paper:

    | Although I'll be explaining in my words how to do everything, you still have to make the effort of learning yourself. Take notes, try to revise stuff, and most importantly, keep practicing. 
    | The pen and paper are also important for flowchart and pseudocode practice, which we'll get to later.

.. note::

   Yes I do know that Online Compilers are a thing, but again, it just makes things unnecessarily complicated. Technically you can learn all of Programming just by reading a book and never even having a computer or even electricity, but it's just not practical. A hands on experience and above all, PRACTICE, is the best way to learn and be good at this.
