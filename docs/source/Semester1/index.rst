| If you're a student from a new admission, here's some advice and general tips to know from the mistakes I've made, so you don't have to.

*    If you need to buy a new machine, get a laptop. If you don't have much money, get a used or refurbished laptop and put an SSD in it.
*    Buy a whiteboard so you can write down your weekly tasks and deadlines and then you can put it in the corner and wake up to it every day.
*    Interact with people and find out more of who they are and what their skills are. You'll be surprised by the level of people in your class from all sorts of places. Make sure you have someone you trust because the only thing standing between you and a bad grade is their ability to explain a concept to you (I'm writing this in the future after someone explained to me 5 weeks of content in 50 minutes and I got 93% in that exam. If you're reading this, thanks dude).
*    You shouldn't worry, you shouldn't complain, and you shouldn't cry. The reason is, it doesn't help. Just breathe, relax, and focus. You got this. Make sure to drink plenty of water.
*    Aim for the highest that YOU can do. Don't compare yourself to others or else you will feel incredibly demotivated. Take the opportunity of a loss to instead learn and improve so you don't repeat those mistakes. In a lot of situations you will have done something correctly, but not in the way the university wanted you to do it. Don't complain about it and don't fight it. Just try to understand it and adapt to it. If you think the degree is brutal, you haven't worked in customer service. It just makes university life feel like heaven.
*    Don't be afraid or hesitant to ask seniors for help. They were where you are now. But also don't consider their words as truth. Sometimes they can screw you over or traditions can change over time. Just take it as advice.
