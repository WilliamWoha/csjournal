Requirements
------------

| Same as before. Nothing new will be needed. So if you managed to finish Programming Fundamentals, then you're all set. The rest of the page is the exact same.
| In later semesters the requirements might get bigger or require you to learn specific topics first. For now though, you don't have to worry about it.
