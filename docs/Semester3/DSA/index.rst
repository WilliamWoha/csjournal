Data Structurs And Algorithms
=============================

| This site is undergoing updates until the Semester finishes. Please refresh the page to make sure it's the latest version.
|
| Data Structures And Algorithms is worth 4 Total Credit Hours. 3 for Theory, and 1 for Lab. That means for 16 weeks, there will be 3 hours a week for Theory and 1 hour a week for Lab. Yes, we do three hours for Lab but that's beside the point. Credit Hours are counted weirdly.
|
| Absolutes if you don't know just means "Out of 100%, it is this many percentage points". So 40 Absolutes means it's worth 40% of the total semester grade.
