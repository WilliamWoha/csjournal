| As of typing, I'm in week 12 of week 16. This time it's not about learning C++. It's about using it to learn Computer Science Concepts. And also surviving Assembly Language as a side objective.

*    Graphviz will be a VERY powerful tool here, but pen and paper also works.
*    Revise Recursion. It's the bread and butter of Binary Trees.
*    You've made it this far, don't stop now. I'm proud of you, you can keep going.

| Fortunately, even though the Semester Content for my university says that Discrete Structures is a CS Course, it doesn't involve any actual programming...for now. So the Subject Count for this semester will just be two: DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms), and COAL (Computer Organization and Assembly Language). COAL is going to be a *nightmare* but it'll be passed with enough practice.
|
| As for the next semester, we'll wait and see, since that supposedly has Operating Systems, Database Systems, and Design And Analysis Of Algorithms. That's a lot of documentation.
