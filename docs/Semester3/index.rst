| As of typing, I'm in week 12 of week 16. This time it's not about learning C++. It's about using it to learn Computer Science Concepts.

*    Graphviz will be a VERY powerful tool here, but pen and paper also works.
*    Revise Recursion. It's the bread and butter of Binary Trees.
*    You've made it this far, don't stop now. I'm proud of you, you can keep going.

| Fortunately, even though the Semester Content for my university says that Discrete Structures is a CS Course, it has almost nothing to do with programming...for now. So the Subject Count for this semester will also just be one, which is Data Structures, since I'm documenting programming exclusive things. And that would *also* include things like Computer Organization And Assembly Language but that's a nuisance and a half. I can't teach something I'm not good at myself.
| As for the next semester, we'll wait and see, since that supposedly has Operating Systems, Database Systems, and Design And Analysis Of Algorithms. That's a lot of documentation.
