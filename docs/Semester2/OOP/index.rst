Object Oriented Programming
===========================

| This site is undergoing updates until the Semester finishes. Please refresh the page to make sure it's the latest version.
|
| Object Oriented Programming is worth 4 Total Credit Hours. 3 for Theory, and 1 for Lab. That means for 16 weeks, there will be 3 hours a week for Theory and 1 hour a week for Lab. Yes, we do three hours for Lab but that's beside the point. Credit Hours are counted weirdly.
|
| Absolutes if you don't know just means "Out of 100%, it is this many percentage points". So 40 Absolutes means it's worth 40% of the total semester grade. Oh by the way, if you're caught with Plagiarism this time, then they'll take away 30 Absolutes. It's better to just leave a task empty instead of copy it from someone else. Don't use ChatGPT and don't get help from someone else, unless they only explain the concept or question better to you. Just improve.
