17) Const Objects
-----------------

| They're regular Objects except the values become read-only after initialization. It also only works on ``const`` member functions. Just google more about them if you need to know, this is an extremely niche use case of Classes. Usually it's easier and more readable to just use ``const`` data members instead. It's very rare to run into a situation where both a non-const and const version of a Class is required. But it's there, if you need it.

Yeah no there's not much else to say about them it's just read-only versions of Classes. I can't even think of any examples for them existing. The concept exists, you can use it, but it's not really a big deal.
