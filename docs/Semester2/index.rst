| Alright congrats on finishing Semester 1! I'm still handling stuff so there's probably a few things to fix here and there but I'll get to it. Find Practice Questions on Leetcode and continue to improve. These are only notes that teach. They won't make you an expert. Only trial and error will.

| As of typing, this Semester just began, so there's not much I can tell. I'll make some edits and update stuff as I learn more. But for now, my advice from Semester 1 still stands.

*    Get a Laptop if you haven't already
*    Get a whiteboard if you haven't already (This one's optional but still super useful)
*    By now you should have people you can trust and rely on
*    You shouldn't worry, you shouldn't complain, and you shouldn't cry. The reason is, it doesn't help. Just breathe, relax, and focus. You got this. Make sure to drink plenty of water.
*    Aim for the highest that YOU can do. Don't compare yourself to others or else you will feel incredibly demotivated. Take the opportunity of a loss to instead learn and improve so you don't repeat those mistakes. In a lot of situations you will have done something correctly, but not in the way the university wanted you to do it. Don't complain about it and don't fight it. Just try to understand it and adapt to it. If you think the degree is brutal, you haven't worked in customer service. It just makes university life feel like heaven.
*    Don't be afraid or hesitant to ask seniors for help. They were where you are now. But also don't consider their words as truth. Sometimes they can screw you over or traditions can change over time. Just take it as advice.

| Also I happened to go over the layout of the subjects in individual semesters. Right now, Semester 1 has only one thing, which is Programming Fundamentals. We had other things too, such as Calculus and Physics. These were subjects I couldn't properly make notes on because I didn't understand them much myself. And explaining them via text only is difficult. So I switched to Programming Only.
| Anyways, I noticed that Semester 2 also only has one thing, which is OOP. Object Oriented Programming. But in Semester 3? We got two things. Data Structures, and Discrete Structures. In Semester 4, it's three things. Database Systems, Operating Systems, and Design & Analysis of Algorithms.
| So, yeah. The earlier semesters will have far less material than the ones that come later. Physics and Calculus and Maths are just included as part of the degree but the main thing is Programming and CS, which is what I'm hoping to document here.
