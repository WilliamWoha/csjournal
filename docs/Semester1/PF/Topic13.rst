13) #include <cmath>
--------------------

| I like these smaller segments. They distract us from the much bigger, much more intimidating sections such as Conditionals.
|
| | So just like how we included the ``<iostream>``, ``<iomanip>``, and ``<string>`` libraries, here's another. But as of now we only studied one function of it. This library is called the ``<cmath>`` library, and it's imported by typing 

.. code-block:: c++

	#include <cmath>

| It only gets used for one command, which is called ``pow(a, b)``. This command gives the result of a :sup:`b` (a power b). It can be used in multiple ways. You can imagine using it the same ways you can use an arithmetic statement.
|
| There's also more uses to it, it's an entire library after all, but for now this is what we've used it for thus far. You can look up the library to see more functions of it.
