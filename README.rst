What this is about
==================

Hi! I’m a student who’s currently in University doing a Bachelor’s of Computer Science. I enjoy gaining knowledge, but it can be a struggle sometimes, not just for me but for everyone. So I decided to make CSJournal, where I’ll be writing down the things I learn in my four years of study and trying to explain them as best I can so anyone can use it to gain knowledge, whether they’re also in a CS program or not.

Everything listed on this website is written directly by me. I’ll be trying my best to make sure everything is accurate and up-to-date, however this whole thing is being managed by ONE person, and I’m also occupied with a few other projects as well, alongside trying to actually complete this degree. There’s no guarantee that the info you will find on this website is fully authentic, so read at your own risk, but I'm trying my absolute best to validate and confirm that the information is valid. If you find any corrections or wish to inform me of anything, you can contact me via Discord at williamwoha
